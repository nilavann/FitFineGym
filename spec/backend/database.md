# Database — Web Edition (Supabase / Postgres)

> **Schema note.** The live backend is the `fitfine` schema in `supabase/migrations/`, which is the source of truth; this page describes its tables, columns and rules, with the grants, access rule (`fitfine_private.access_of`), constraints, triggers, policies, views and API functions those migrations define. How the frontend calls it: [../frontend/backend-api.md](../frontend/backend-api.md).

> Part of: [SPEC-WEB.md](../../SPEC-WEB.md) | App: Fit&Fine Gym Subscription Manager (Web)

>
> Two rules apply uniformly across every table below unless a table is explicitly marked exempt:
> 1. **Deletes are real, guarded and audited.** Members, subscriptions, subscription items, plans, branches and roles have no `deleted_at` / `deleted_by` and are deleted for real, only through a `delete_*` function that runs the usage guard first (clients hold no `DELETE` grant). The audit trigger records the deleted row's last values. **Users are never deleted, only deactivated**, and `audit_log` can never be deleted.
> 2. **There is nothing to filter.** No RLS policy, view or validation query needs a `deleted_at is null` condition, because no such column exists; a uniqueness rule holds across every row.
>
> **Cancellation/refund and overlap-warning logic are deferred** — see [domain-model.md §Open items](./domain-model.md#open-items-not-blocking-but-worth-resolving-before-implementation-begins). `subscriptions` and `subscription_items` below intentionally have no `status`/`refund_amount`/`cancellation_reason`/`overlap_*` columns yet.

## Setup

- Engine: **Supabase Postgres** (hosted, online-only).
- Auth: **Supabase Auth** (`auth.users`), email + password and Google OAuth. Never build a parallel credentials table.
- Storage: **Supabase Storage**, bucket `member-photos`, for member profile photos.
- Serverless logic: **Supabase Edge Functions** (Deno + TypeScript) for anything that must not be trusted to the client — see [architecture.md](../architecture.md).
- Schema changes reach the project **only** via migration files in `supabase/migrations/` (`supabase db push` / the Supabase CLI). No ad-hoc changes through the dashboard SQL editor for anything that needs to persist.

```sql
create extension if not exists "pgcrypto";
```

Needed for `gen_random_uuid()` (profiles reuse `auth.users.id`, so this is mostly a safety default; `audit_log.change_id` is the actual consumer — see below).

---

## Hard Delete Guards

There are no soft-delete columns. Each deletable table is protected by a usage guard instead:

| Table | Deleted by | Refused while | Backstop |
|---|---|---|---|
| `members` | `delete_member` | any `subscription_items` row names the member as `member_id` or `shared_member_id` | `subscription_items.member_id` / `shared_member_id` FK, no cascade |
| `subscriptions` + `subscription_items` | `delete_subscription` (items first, then the header) | never — nothing refers to a checkout | — |
| `plans` | `delete_plan` | any `subscription_items` row uses the plan | `subscription_items.plan_id` FK, `ON DELETE RESTRICT` |
| `branches` | `delete_branch` | any member belongs to the branch | `members.branch_id` FK, no cascade (its `member_number_sequences` row is deleted with it: `ON DELETE CASCADE`) |
| `roles` | `delete_role` | any `user_roles` row uses it | `user_roles.role_id` FK, no cascade |
| `profiles` | never | always — a user is only deactivated (`is_active = false`) | `prevent_hard_delete()` |
| `audit_log` | never | always — append-only | `prevent_hard_delete()` |

Each `delete_*` function is `security definer`, `service_role`-only, starts with `act_as(caller)` so the audit rows name the caller, locks the row, runs its guard and deletes in one transaction. `configuration` and `member_number_sequences` are internal system tables with no product concept of deleting a row (a counter row goes with its branch).

## SQL Schema

```sql
-- 1. profiles — one row per auth.users row. Role no longer lives here — see roles/
-- user_roles below (§Role Assignment) — a user can hold more than one role. No `on delete
-- cascade` on the FK (unlike every other business table's FKs, this was the one exception,
-- now removed) — deactivation is the only supported way to remove a user's access; a
-- Supabase Auth admin.deleteUser() call now fails outright with a foreign-key violation
-- instead of cascading into a real DELETE on this row.
create table if not exists profiles (
  id          uuid primary key references auth.users(id),
  full_name   text not null,
  is_active   boolean not null default true,
  created_at  timestamptz not null default now(),
  created_by  uuid references profiles(id),
  changed_at  timestamptz,

-- 2. branches
create table if not exists branches (

create table if not exists plans (
  id             bigint generated always as identity primary key,

-- 5. user_roles — many-to-many: a user can hold more than one role. Deliberately NOT
-- deleted via a flag — a role grant/revoke is a real INSERT/DELETE, same class of exception as
-- member_number_sequences (below), except this table IS
-- audited (see §Field-Level Audit Trigger) since it's admin-facing, unlike that one.

## Views

### `profiles_with_roles`

A plain view (no `security definer`) — inherits and enforces the querying user's own RLS
against `profiles`/`user_roles`/`roles` automatically, adding no new permission surface. Read
path for `AuthContext`'s own-profile fetch and for `list-users` (edge-functions.md §5).

```sql
create or replace view profiles_with_roles as
select
  p.id,
  p.full_name,
  p.is_active,
  coalesce(ur.role_names, '{}') as roles
from profiles p
left join lateral (
  select array_agg(r.name order by r.name) as role_names
  from user_roles ur
  join roles r on r.id = ur.role_id
  where ur.user_id = p.id
) ur on true;
```

### `member_current_items`

"What does this member currently have," across every `subscriptions` row they're part of — see [domain-model.md §Views](./domain-model.md#views) for the full explanation of why this always means a `UNION ALL` across two roles (`member_id` and `shared_member_id`) rather than a single-table lookup.

```sql
create or replace view member_current_items as
select
  si.id as subscription_item_id, si.subscription_id, si.plan_id,
  p.name as plan_name, p.category,
  si.member_id, si.start_date, si.end_date, si.quantity, si.amount_paid
from subscription_items si
join plans p on p.id = si.plan_id
where (si.end_date is null or si.end_date >= current_date)

union all

select
  si.id, si.subscription_id, si.plan_id,
  p.name, p.category,
  si.shared_member_id as member_id, si.start_date, si.end_date, si.quantity, si.amount_paid
from subscription_items si
join plans p on p.id = si.plan_id
where si.shared_member_id is not null
  and (si.end_date is null or si.end_date >= current_date);
```

Backed by `idx_subscription_items_member_end` and `idx_subscription_items_shared_member_end` above — a plain `current_date` comparison can't live inside a partial index predicate (not `IMMUTABLE`), so these are ordinary composite indexes that support an efficient `member_id = ? and end_date >= ?` range scan for each half of the `UNION ALL`, rather than partial indexes baking the date filter in.

Usage: `select * from member_current_items where member_id = :member_id order by end_date nulls last desc;`

---

## Role Assignment

`roles`/`user_roles` replace the old single `profiles.role` column — a user can hold more
than one role. Seed rows (`admin`, `staff`) are listed under §Seed Data below; beyond that,
`roles` is a normal admin-editable catalog (Manage Roles screen), same as branches/plans.

`is_admin_user(p_user_id)` is the single source of truth for "is this specific user an
active admin" — used both by RLS (`is_active_admin()` now just delegates to it) and by every
Edge Function's admin-check, replacing what used to be a duplicated inline
`profiles.select('role', ...)` query in five different functions:

```sql
create or replace function is_admin_user(p_user_id uuid)
returns boolean
language sql
stable
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
  select exists (
    select 1
    from profiles p
    join user_roles ur on ur.user_id = p.id
    join roles r on r.id = ur.role_id and r.name = 'admin'
    where p.id = p_user_id and p.is_active = true
  );
$$;

create or replace function is_active_admin()
returns boolean
language sql
stable
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
  select is_admin_user(auth.uid());
$$;
```

**Last-admin lockout**: `count_other_active_admins(p_exclude_user_id)` backs a guard applied
everywhere a user's admin access could be removed — revoking the admin role
(`replace_user_roles` below), deactivating (`is_active = false`), or soft-deleting a user
(`update-user`, edge-functions.md §5) — all three are blocked with a clear error if the
target is the last active admin.

**`replace_user_roles`** is the only write path for `user_roles` — no client role has any
RLS grant on that table at all (see §Row Level Security), so this Edge-Function-only RPC is
the sole way a user's role set ever changes, closing the self-escalation gap that used to
exist on `profiles.role` (see the old `profiles_update_self_name` policy, still present below
for `full_name` only):

```sql
create or replace function replace_user_roles(
  p_caller_id       uuid,
  p_target_user_id  uuid,
  p_role_ids        smallint[]
)
returns jsonb
language plpgsql
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
declare
  v_had_admin   boolean;
  v_keeps_admin boolean;
begin
  perform set_config('request.jwt.claim.sub', p_caller_id::text, true);

  select is_admin_user(p_target_user_id) into v_had_admin;
  select exists (
    select 1 from roles where id = any(p_role_ids) and name = 'admin'
  ) into v_keeps_admin;

  if v_had_admin and not v_keeps_admin and count_other_active_admins(p_target_user_id) = 0 then
    raise exception 'Cannot remove the admin role — % is the last active admin', p_target_user_id;
  end if;

  delete from user_roles where user_id = p_target_user_id;
  insert into user_roles (user_id, role_id, granted_by)
  select p_target_user_id, role_id, p_caller_id from unnest(p_role_ids) as role_id;

  return (
    select jsonb_agg(r.name order by r.name)
    from user_roles ur join roles r on r.id = ur.role_id
    where ur.user_id = p_target_user_id
  );
end;
$$;

revoke all on function replace_user_roles(uuid, uuid, smallint[]) from public;
grant execute on function replace_user_roles(uuid, uuid, smallint[]) to service_role;
```

**`update_profile_fields`** exists for the same reason: now that
`set_audit_fields()` is attached to `profiles`, `update-user`'s `full_name`/`is_active` edits
need the `set_config` attribution trick too, so a plain service-role
`.update()` isn't enough — it is a tiny RPC (`update profiles set ... where id = ...`)
doing that `perform set_config(...)` first, `service_role`-only like
every RPC above. There is no `soft_delete_profile` or `restore_profile`: users are never deleted.

---

## Configuration Table

A generic key/value settings table so operational constants don't require a schema migration to change. Currently used only for member-number generation (below); more keys can be added the same way later.

```sql
insert into configuration (key, value, description) values
  ('member_number_start_sequence', '1', 'First sequence number issued to a branch, the first time that branch is ever used.'),
  ('member_number_increment',      '1', 'Step size between consecutive member numbers within a branch. The counter never resets.'),
  ('member_number_padding_width',  '4', 'Zero-padding width for the sequence portion of member_number, e.g. 4 -> 0001.')
on conflict (key) do nothing;
```

(The counter is continuous per branch and never resets.)

If a branch ever approaches 9,999 members total, an admin can raise `member_number_padding_width` to `5` without a schema migration — existing already-issued numbers are unaffected since the width only applies at generation time.

---

## Member Number Generation

`member_number` is never accepted from the client and is always overwritten by this trigger, the same pattern `set_audit_fields()` uses for the audit columns — except this one also fires on `UPDATE`, purely to pin `member_number` and `branch_id` back to their original values. A member's branch is a registration-time fact, set once and never reassigned (REQ-MEM-005/006), so `branch_id` gets the same immutability treatment as `member_number` itself — otherwise the branch code baked into `member_number` at creation could silently drift out of sync with a member's current `branch_id`.

```sql
create or replace function generate_member_number()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
declare
  v_branch_code text;
  v_year        integer := extract(year from now())::integer;
  v_start       integer;
  v_increment   integer;
  v_width       integer;
  v_sequence    integer;
begin
  if tg_op = 'UPDATE' then
    -- Frozen forever: no branch/number reassignment path exists, and this must never
    -- touch member_number_sequences — an UPDATE returns here, before that code is reached.
    new.member_number := old.member_number;
    new.branch_id      := old.branch_id;
    return new;
  end if;

  select code into v_branch_code from branches where id = new.branch_id;
  if v_branch_code is null then
    raise exception 'branch_id % does not reference an active branch', new.branch_id;
  end if;

  select value::integer into v_start     from configuration where key = 'member_number_start_sequence';
  select value::integer into v_increment from configuration where key = 'member_number_increment';
  select value::integer into v_width     from configuration where key = 'member_number_padding_width';

  -- Atomic per-branch counter, continuous for the branch's whole lifetime: first row for a
  -- branch starts at v_start; every subsequent insert adds v_increment to the existing
  -- counter, with no reset at a calendar-year boundary or anywhere else. The INSERT ... ON
  -- CONFLICT takes a row lock, so this is safe under concurrent member creation. Only ever
  -- reached on INSERT (see the tg_op = 'UPDATE' branch above) — an update can never bump this.
  insert into member_number_sequences (branch_id, last_sequence)
  values (new.branch_id, v_start)
  on conflict (branch_id)
  do update set last_sequence = member_number_sequences.last_sequence + v_increment
  returning last_sequence into v_sequence;

  new.member_number := v_branch_code || '-' || v_year || '-' || lpad(v_sequence::text, v_width, '0');
  return new;
end;
$$;

create trigger trg_members_generate_number
  before insert or update on members
  for each row execute function generate_member_number();
```

**Why a failed insert can't leak a sequence bump:** the counter increment happens inside this `BEFORE INSERT` trigger, as part of the same statement/transaction as the row insert itself. `NOT NULL`/`CHECK`/`UNIQUE` constraints (`chk_doctor_care_details_required`, `idx_members_phone_active`, etc.) are validated by Postgres *after* all `BEFORE ROW` triggers finish, using the trigger-modified row — so if any of them reject the row, the whole statement aborts and everything it did, including the nested `insert into member_number_sequences`, rolls back with it. The only residual gap risk is a benign concurrency artifact (two concurrent inserts where one later rolls back after the other already claimed the next number) — an accepted trade-off for a display identifier, not something worth serializing inserts to avoid.

**Trigger firing order doesn't matter here.** `generate_member_number()` and `set_audit_fields()` touch disjoint columns (`member_number`/`branch_id` vs. the audit block), so whichever of the two `BEFORE` triggers runs first produces an identical final row either way — there's no dependency to protect by naming/ordering them a particular way. The `after insert`/`after update` audit-log trigger always sees the fully-resolved row regardless, since Postgres only fires `AFTER ROW` triggers once every `BEFORE ROW` trigger has already applied its changes to `NEW`.

---

## Delete Protection

The `delete_*` functions (§Hard Delete Guards) are the only way a business row is removed. Underneath them, no table grants clients a `DELETE`, no RLS `delete` policy exists, and the foreign keys have no cascade, so a code path that skipped a guard would still be stopped by the database. Two tables must never lose a row at all, and `prevent_hard_delete()` enforces that at the trigger level, whichever role attempts it:

```sql
create or replace function fitfine_private.prevent_hard_delete()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
set search_path = ''
as $$
begin
  raise exception 'Hard delete is not allowed on table %.', tg_table_name;
end;
$$;

create trigger trg_profiles_no_hard_delete  before delete on profiles  for each row execute function fitfine_private.prevent_hard_delete();
create trigger trg_audit_log_no_hard_delete before delete on audit_log for each row execute function fitfine_private.prevent_hard_delete();
```

`user_roles` is attached to neither: a role grant/revoke is a real `INSERT`/`DELETE`, audited by the audit trigger, like the delete of any other row. `member_number_sequences` is an internal counter and is deleted only with its branch.

---

## Audit Field Triggers

The client never sets `created_by` / `changed_by` / `changed_at` — a trigger reads the authenticated caller from `auth.uid()`.

```sql
create or replace function set_audit_fields()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
begin
  if tg_op = 'INSERT' then
    new.created_at := now();
    new.created_by := auth.uid();
    new.changed_at := null;
    new.changed_by := null;
  elsif tg_op = 'UPDATE' then
    new.created_at := old.created_at;
    new.created_by := old.created_by;
    new.changed_at := now();
    new.changed_by := auth.uid();
  end if;
  return new;
end;
$$;

create trigger trg_profiles_audit             before insert or update on profiles             for each row execute function set_audit_fields();
create trigger trg_branches_audit             before insert or update on branches             for each row execute function set_audit_fields();
create trigger trg_plans_audit                before insert or update on plans                for each row execute function set_audit_fields();
create trigger trg_roles_audit                before insert or update on roles                for each row execute function set_audit_fields();
create trigger trg_members_audit              before insert or update on members              for each row execute function set_audit_fields();
create trigger trg_subscriptions_audit        before insert or update on subscriptions        for each row execute function set_audit_fields();
create trigger trg_subscription_items_audit   before insert or update on subscription_items   for each row execute function set_audit_fields();
```

`profiles` is attached like every other table now (it was the one exception until the
roles-and-user-roles migration). The one
wrinkle: a profile's `created_by` means "the admin who invited them," set via
`handle_new_auth_user()` below, not the row owner's own `auth.uid()` — see that section for
how the two are reconciled.

---

## Profile Creation Trigger

A `profiles` row is created automatically whenever a new `auth.users` row appears (via `invite-user` Edge Function or the bootstrap step). `full_name` arrives via `raw_user_meta_data`, set by the Edge Function at invite time. **Role assignment happens separately, after this trigger runs** — `invite-user` inserts into `user_roles` explicitly once it has the new user's id back from the invite call (see edge-functions.md §5); this trigger no longer touches role at all.

`created_at`/`created_by` are no longer literal `INSERT` values — `set_audit_fields()` (just attached above) stamps them the same as every other table. The wrinkle: `set_audit_fields()` reads `auth.uid()`, which would otherwise resolve to `NULL` here, since this trigger runs under whatever connection created the `auth.users` row (e.g. `invite-user`'s service-role client), not the inviting admin's own session. Faking the JWT claim for this transaction only (`LOCAL`, auto-reset at commit) lets `created_by` still correctly attribute to the inviting admin — the same trick `create_subscription_with_items` uses (§subscription RPC functions). Left unset for the one-time bootstrap admin (no inviter), so `created_by` naturally stays `NULL` there too.

```sql
create or replace function handle_new_auth_user()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
declare
  v_invited_by uuid := nullif(new.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'invited_by', '')::uuid;
begin
  if v_invited_by is not null then
    perform set_config('request.jwt.claim.sub', v_invited_by::text, true);
  end if;

  insert into profiles (id, full_name, is_active)
  values (
    new.id,
    coalesce(new.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'full_name', new.email),
    true
  )
  on conflict (id) do nothing;
  return new;
end;
$$;

create trigger trg_handle_new_auth_user
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute function handle_new_auth_user();
```

This applies identically regardless of whether the user's first sign-in ends up being password or Google OAuth — both land on the same `auth.users` row, and this trigger only cares about the row's creation, not which credential type accompanies it.

---

## Field-Level Audit Trigger (REQ-AUDIT-001)

Generic, attached to every business table (not `audit_log` itself). Compares `OLD`/`NEW` column-by-column via `to_jsonb`, skipping the audit-metadata columns (per REQ-AUDIT-001's acceptance criteria — those are metadata, not business data). The trigger fires on `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE`: a delete writes one `audit_log` row per column with the row's last values in `old_value` and `operation = 'delete'`, attributed to the acting user, so the record is gone but its history is not.

```sql
create or replace function audit_row_changes()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
security definer
set search_path = public
as $$
declare
  v_change_id uuid := gen_random_uuid();
  v_old       jsonb;
  v_new       jsonb;
  v_record_id text;
  v_key       text;
  v_excluded  text[] := array['created_at', 'created_by', 'changed_at', 'changed_by'];
begin
  if tg_op = 'INSERT' then
    v_new := to_jsonb(new);
    v_record_id := v_new ->> 'id';
    for v_key in select jsonb_object_keys(v_new) loop
      if v_key <> all(v_excluded) then
        insert into audit_log (change_id, table_name, record_id, field_name, old_value, new_value, operation, changed_by, changed_at)
        values (v_change_id, tg_table_name, v_record_id, v_key, null, v_new ->> v_key, 'insert', auth.uid(), now());
      end if;
    end loop;
    return new;

  elsif tg_op = 'UPDATE' then
    v_old := to_jsonb(old);
    v_new := to_jsonb(new);
    v_record_id := v_new ->> 'id';
    for v_key in select jsonb_object_keys(v_new) loop
      if v_key <> all(v_excluded) and (v_old ->> v_key) is distinct from (v_new ->> v_key) then
        insert into audit_log (change_id, table_name, record_id, field_name, old_value, new_value, operation, changed_by, changed_at)
        values (v_change_id, tg_table_name, v_record_id, v_key, v_old ->> v_key, v_new ->> v_key, 'update', auth.uid(), now());
      end if;
    end loop;
    return new;

  elsif tg_op = 'DELETE' then
    -- Reached by every audited table when a row is deleted through its delete_* function,
    -- and by user_roles on a role revoke.
    -- user_roles has no surrogate `id` column; its natural key is (user_id, role_id).
    -- Read via v_old (jsonb), not direct OLD.field access, same as every other branch —
    -- this function is shared across tables with different columns.
    v_old := to_jsonb(old);
    v_record_id := coalesce(v_old ->> 'id', (v_old ->> 'user_id') || ':' || (v_old ->> 'role_id'));
    for v_key in select jsonb_object_keys(v_old) loop
      if v_key <> all(v_excluded) then
        insert into audit_log (change_id, table_name, record_id, field_name, old_value, new_value, operation, changed_by, changed_at)
        values (v_change_id, tg_table_name, v_record_id, v_key, v_old ->> v_key, null, 'delete', auth.uid(), now());
      end if;
    end loop;
    return old;
  end if;

  return null;
end;
$$;

create trigger trg_profiles_audit_fields            after insert or update on profiles            for each row execute function audit_row_changes();
create trigger trg_branches_audit_fields             after insert or update on branches             for each row execute function audit_row_changes();
create trigger trg_plans_audit_fields                after insert or update on plans                for each row execute function audit_row_changes();
create trigger trg_roles_audit_fields                after insert or update on roles                for each row execute function audit_row_changes();

create trigger trg_subscription_items_audit_fields   after insert or update on subscription_items   for each row execute function audit_row_changes();
```

These are `after` triggers, so they read the row's *final* state — after `set_audit_fields()` and (for `members`) `generate_member_number()` have both already run as `before` triggers. `user_roles` is the one table using `after insert or delete` instead of `after insert or update` — it has no `update` path (a role change is a delete-then-insert, see `replace_user_roles` in §Role Assignment) and no `set_audit_fields`/`changed_at` columns of its own.

## Row Level Security (RLS)

RLS is **enabled on every table**: the web client cannot be trusted, so every access rule is enforced here, not just in the UI. This is the actual enforcement layer for access control on the web — every rule in [business-logic.md](./business-logic.md) that matters for security must also exist as an RLS policy or Edge Function check, not just a UI check.

```sql
alter table profiles               enable row level security;
alter table branches                enable row level security;
alter table plans                   enable row level security;
alter table roles                   enable row level security;
alter table user_roles              enable row level security;
alter table configuration           enable row level security;
alter table members                 enable row level security;
alter table member_number_sequences enable row level security;
alter table subscriptions           enable row level security;
alter table subscription_items      enable row level security;
alter table audit_log               enable row level security;

```

**Deactivated users are blocked everywhere immediately**, not just at login: every policy above gates on `is_active_user()` / `is_active_admin()`, so a deactivated account's existing session immediately loses read/write access on its next request even if the client-side session token is still technically valid.

## Storage

Bucket `member-photos` — **private**, not public:

```sql
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
values ('member-photos', 'member-photos', false, 5242880, array['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/webp'])
on conflict (id) do nothing;

create policy "member_photos_read_active_users" on storage.objects
  for select using (bucket_id = 'member-photos' and is_active_user());

create policy "member_photos_write_active_users" on storage.objects
  for insert with check (bucket_id = 'member-photos' and is_active_user());

create policy "member_photos_update_active_users" on storage.objects
  for update using (bucket_id = 'member-photos' and is_active_user());
```

Made private because object keys are predictable (`{memberId}/original-{timestamp}.jpg`, sequential bigint ids) — a fully public bucket meant anyone with a guessed URL could view any member's photo with no session at all. Reads now require `is_active_user()`, same bar as every other member field, via short-lived signed URLs generated client-side (`frontend/src/lib/photo-urls.ts`) rather than a permanent public URL — `members.photo_url`/`photo_thumbnail_url` accordingly store a bucket-relative **path**, not a URL (a signed URL itself can't be persisted, it expires). See [member-management.md §8](./member-management.md#8-storage-member-photos-bucket) for the full write-up.

---

## Seed Data

```sql

values
  ('admin', 'Full access — user/role/catalog management plus everything staff can do.'),
  ('staff', 'Day-to-day member and subscription management.')
on conflict (name) do nothing;

insert into branches (name, code)
values ('Main Branch', 'MUM')
on conflict (code) do nothing;

insert into plans (name, category, duration_days, price, max_members)
values
  ('Day',             'membership', 1,    100,  1),
  ('Monthly',          'membership', 30,   1000, 1),
  ('Quarterly',         'membership', 90,   2500, 1),
  ('Annual',            'membership', 365,  8000, 1),
  ('Couple Monthly',    'membership', 30,   1800, 2),
  ('Membership Fee',    'addon',      null, 500,  1),
  ('Zumba Class',       'addon',      30,   800,  1)
on conflict (name) do nothing;
```

Configuration seed rows are listed under §Configuration Table above. `profiles` has **no automatic seed** — see below.

## Bootstrapping the First Admin

A hosted Supabase project has no "first launch" moment, and auto-seeding a well-known admin credential into a public-facing database would be a security hole. The first admin account is created **once, manually**, by whoever sets up the Supabase project:

1. In the Supabase dashboard (or via the Admin API), create the first `auth.users` row with the real admin's email, using **Auth → Invite User** or `supabase.auth.admin.createUser()` from a trusted, non-deployed script.
2. Set `raw_user_meta_data = { "full_name": "..." }` on that call so the `handle_new_auth_user` trigger creates the matching `profiles` row.
3. Grant the admin role directly, since there is no admin yet to call `invite-user`:
   ```sql
   insert into user_roles (user_id, role_id)
   select '<the new auth.users.id>', id from roles where name = 'admin';
   ```
4. From then on, every other user is created through the in-app **Invite User** flow (`invite-user` Edge Function, admin-only), which assigns roles via `user_roles` directly and sets `raw_user_meta_data.invited_by` to the inviting admin's id.

This one-time step must be documented in the project's deployment runbook — it is not something the app's own UI does, since there is no logged-in admin yet the first time it runs.

---

## No reserved roles

The `system_admin` role (REQ-ADMIN-010), its `protect_system_admin_role()` trigger, the `is_system_admin` access flag and the checks in `replace_user_roles()` / `delete_role()` were removed by `20261028000200_remove_system_admin.sql`, which also deletes the role row and its grants (a user who held it keeps `admin`). `fitfine_private.access` is `(is_active, is_admin)`; `user_access()` returns the same two flags plus `other_active_admins`.

---

## Query Conventions

- All client queries go through `supabase-js`, which parameterizes automatically — never build raw SQL strings from user input, on the client or in an Edge Function.
- Dates compared as Postgres `date` — native comparison, no string hacks.
- `end_date` is always computed server-side (Edge Function), never sent by the client — see [architecture.md](../architecture.md).
- `changed_at` / `changed_by` are never set by the client — see §Audit Field Triggers above.
- Every hand-written query — reports, uniqueness checks, deletion/usage guards, `member_current_items`-style aggregation — needs no deleted-row filter: there is no such column. A delete is permanent, so a query only ever sees rows that exist.

---

## Migrations

The schema is built by the files in `supabase/migrations/`, applied in order (`supabase db push`). Running all of them against an empty Supabase project produces the complete database.

```

New schema changes always get a new migration file — never edit an already-applied migration.
