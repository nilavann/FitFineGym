## 2. Feature Area: Member Management

### 2.1 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Who can do it | Priority (Must/Should/Could) |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-MEM-001 | Staff/admin can register a new member with: name, date of birth (mandatory), phone, date of joining, branch, gender (Male/Female/Other), weight (kg), height (cm), "under doctor's care" flag (+ explanation if yes), and emergency contact (name, mobile, relationship) — all required. Plus optional: email, photo, residential address, aadhaar number, occupation. Phone number must be unique across all (non-deleted) members. | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-MEM-002 | Staff/admin can capture a member's photo directly via device camera at registration time, in addition to uploading an existing image file. | staff, admin | Could |
| REQ-MEM-003 | Every member record stores who created it (system-set, immutable) and a separate, independently editable "handled by" staff field for cases where one staff member enters data on behalf of another. Settable at registration (defaulting to the logged-in staff/admin creating the record, changeable before submit) and independently editable afterward from the member's own page — same field either way, always distinct from `created_by`. | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-MEM-004 | A member's photo is compressed client-side (in the browser) before upload, targeting ~400px on the longest side and under ~50KB. Both the original file and the compressed version are uploaded and stored. | staff, admin | Should |
| REQ-MEM-005 | Every member is assigned a unique, system-generated member number at creation, formatted `<branch code>-<year>-<sequence>` (e.g. `MUM-2026-0001`). The sequence increments continuously per branch and **never resets** — `<year>` reflects the member's actual registration year, not a counter-reset boundary (e.g. a branch's second-ever member might be `MUM-2025-0002`, and its next member the following year `MUM-2026-0003`, not `MUM-2026-0001`). **Revised** from an earlier "resets to 0001 each year" design — see [backend/member-management.md §3](./backend/member-management.md#3-member-number-generation-req-mem-005). | system (staff/admin never enter it) | Must |
| REQ-MEM-006 | Staff/admin can edit an existing member's details — every field is editable except `member_number` (system-generated, immutable), `created_by` (system-set, immutable, see REQ-MEM-003), and `branch_id` (set once at registration, immutable — REQ-MEM-005's branch code is baked into `member_number` at creation and never revisited). | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-MEM-007 | Staff/admin can delete a member. There is no separate "deactivate" state — deleting a member follows the same soft-delete convention as every other entity (`deleted_at`/`deleted_by` set, see Section 11); the member is then excluded from the member list, search, and reports by default. Its `phone` becomes free for reuse by a new member (since phone uniqueness only applies among non-deleted members); `member_number` is never reused. | staff, admin | Should |

### 2.2 Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-MEM-001**
- Given all required fields are filled in, when staff submits, then the member record is created.
- Given any required field is missing, when staff submits, then registration is blocked with a validation error naming the missing field(s).
- Given "under doctor's care" = Yes, when staff leaves the explanation text blank, then submission is blocked with a validation error — the explanation is mandatory whenever the flag is Yes.
- Given staff opens the new member form, when the form loads, then `date_of_joining` is pre-filled with today's date (browser local date).
- Given the pre-filled `date_of_joining` value, when staff changes it before submitting, then the manually entered date is saved instead of today's date.
- Given staff submits a phone number already used by another (non-deleted) member, when they submit, then registration is blocked with a validation error naming the conflict.

**REQ-MEM-002**
- Given staff chooses "take photo", when they capture via camera, then the captured image is used exactly like an uploaded photo (same storage, same field).
- Given the browser/device denies camera access, then staff can still fall back to uploading a file.

**REQ-MEM-003**
- Given a member is created, when saved, then `created_by` is set automatically from the logged-in session and can never be edited afterward, by anyone.
- Given staff/admin opens the new member form, when the form loads, then "handled by staff" is pre-filled with the logged-in user, editable via a dropdown of active staff/admin before submit — same non-required-but-defaulted treatment as `date_of_joining`.
- Given a different staff member should get credit for handling the signup, when any staff or admin (not admin-only) edits the "handled by" field — at registration or afterward from the member's own page — then it updates independently of `created_by`.

**REQ-MEM-004**
- Given staff selects or captures a photo, when it is ready to upload, then the browser compresses it client-side to ~400px on the longest side, targeting under ~50KB, before the upload request is made.
- Given compression completes, when the upload happens, then both the original file (`photo_url`) and the compressed file (`photo_thumbnail_url`) are stored, each with its own URL.
- Given a screen needs to display a member's photo (list, card, thumbnail), when rendering, then it uses `photo_thumbnail_url` for speed; the original `photo_url` is retained but not necessarily shown by default.
- Given compression or the photo upload fails, when staff submits the form, then the rest of the member's details still save successfully as a separate step from the photo — the member record is created regardless — and staff sees an error message stating the photo couldn't be uploaded, with the option to retry the photo upload afterward on that member's record.

**REQ-MEM-006**
- Given staff/admin opens an existing member's edit form, when they change any editable field and submit, then the record is updated and `changed_by`/`changed_at` are set from the session (system, unchanged from the existing audit pattern).
- Given staff/admin submits a phone number already used by another (non-deleted) member — whether creating (REQ-MEM-001) or editing (REQ-MEM-006) — then submission is blocked with a validation error naming the conflict.
- Given the edit form, when it is shown, then `member_number`, `created_by`, and `branch_id` are displayed read-only and are never sent as editable inputs.
- Given an update payload includes a changed `branch_id` (e.g. a forged direct API call), when it reaches the database, then `branch_id` is silently pinned back to its existing value — same enforcement as `member_number`.

**REQ-MEM-007**
- Given staff/admin deletes a member, when confirmed, then the member's `deleted_at` is set to the current time and `deleted_by` to the acting staff/admin — the row is never physically removed.
- Given a deleted member, when the member list, search, filters, or reports are queried, then that member is excluded by default, same as any other soft-deleted entity (Section 11).
- Given a deleted member's phone number, when a new member is registered or an existing member is edited with that same phone number, then it is accepted — uniqueness (REQ-MEM-001/006) only applies among non-deleted members.
- Given a deleted member, when its subscriptions/add-ons/audit history are considered, then those associated records are unaffected and still retained — deleting a member does not cascade-delete or alter its `Subscription`/`SubscriptionAddOn` rows.

### 2.3 Data touched

- **Member** (required): name, phone, date_of_joining (today's date by default — editable), date_of_birth, gender, weight, height, branch_id (FK → Branch, selected at registration — see REQ-MEM-005), under_doctor_care (yes/no), doctor_care_details (text, relevant when under_doctor_care = yes), emergency_contact_name, emergency_contact_phone, emergency_contact_relationship
- **Member** (optional): email, photo_url (original, uncompressed), photo_thumbnail_url (**new**, compressed version — see REQ-MEM-004), residential_address, aadhaar_number, occupation
- **Member** (new, system/audit): created_by (existing, immutable, unchanged), handled_by_staff (**new** field, references a staff/admin profile, independently editable — not the same as created_by/changed_by), deleted_at (timestamptz, nullable), deleted_by (uuid FK → profile, nullable — see REQ-MEM-007, standard soft-delete columns per Section 11)

### 2.4 Business rules specific to this area

- `created_by` / `changed_by` remain system-set via the existing audit trigger and are never client-editable — unchanged from the current spec.
- `handled_by_staff` is a separately editable field — it does not affect or overwrite `created_by`. Settable at registration (defaults to the logged-in user, changeable before submit) and independently editable afterward from the member's page — same column, same rule, at either point in time.
- Photo capture supports both live camera capture and file upload; either path feeds the same compression step (REQ-MEM-004) before storage.
- Compression happens client-side, before upload; both the original (`photo_url`) and compressed (`photo_thumbnail_url`) files are stored — never only one.
- Display surfaces (member list, cards, thumbnails) use `photo_thumbnail_url` by default for load speed.
- "Under doctor's care" defaults to No; the explanation field is only shown/relevant when it is Yes.
- `date_of_joining` defaults to today's date (browser local date) but is editable by staff before submitting.
- `Member.phone` is unique across all non-deleted members — enforced on both create (REQ-MEM-001) and edit (REQ-MEM-006), blocking submission with a validation error on conflict.
- Deleting a member (REQ-MEM-007) always means soft delete (`deleted_at`/`deleted_by` set) — there is no separate "deactivate" state for members, and no hard delete; a deleted member's `Subscription`/`SubscriptionAddOn`/`AuditLog` history is retained unchanged.
- `Member.branch_id` is required at registration (REQ-MEM-001) and feeds the member-number generator (REQ-MEM-005); it carries no access-control or filtering meaning today (see Section 11 Constraints for the full branch-scoping note). It is set once at registration and immutable thereafter (REQ-MEM-006) — a member is never reassigned to a different branch, since `member_number`'s embedded branch code is never recomputed after creation.
- `member_number` is guaranteed unique by its generation algorithm (a continuously-incrementing per-branch sequence that never resets, REQ-MEM-005) and is never client-editable, so no separate uniqueness check is needed for it.

## 3. Feature Area: Member List / Home Page

### 3.1 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Who can do it | Priority (Must/Should/Could) |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-LIST-001 | All signed-in users land on `/` and see the full member list by default (no search/filter applied) sorted by `date_of_joining` **descending** — most recently joined members shown first. Staff can also explicitly re-sort by member name or by their current membership item's expiry date. Detailed layout, search/filter controls, row content, and empty states are already specified in [screens.md](./frontend/screens.md); this requirement adds the default-sort decision and the extra sort options that file left open. | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-LIST-002 | Staff/admin can search the member list by name, member number (the generated ID from REQ-MEM-005), or phone number — substring match, case-insensitive, phone match ignores spaces. | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-LIST-003 | Pill-style quick filters — All / Active / Expiring / Expired — single-select, based on the member's current membership item (**resolved** — see [backend/member-management.md §5–6](./backend/member-management.md#5-member_list_view--resolving-the-member-status-open-question)), using the same status definitions and 7-day "expiring soon" threshold already defined in business-logic.md. | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-LIST-004 | A detailed filter panel additionally lets staff/admin filter by gender, attached add-on, and subscription plan — combinable with each other, the pill filter, and the search box. (Age-range filtering was considered and removed from scope for now — see Section 12.) | staff, admin | Should |

### 3.2 Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-LIST-001**
- Given a signed-in user loads `/` with no search query and no filters applied, when the list renders, then members are ordered by `date_of_joining` descending (newest joiner first).
- Given the user explicitly picks a different sort (e.g. `name-asc`, `expiry-asc`, or clicking a desktop table column header per screens.md), when the list re-sorts, then that explicit choice overrides the default until the user clears it or reloads the page.
- Given the user searches or applies filters, when results are shown, then they are still ordered by `date_of_joining` descending unless the user has separately chosen another sort.
- Given the sort control, when staff open it, then the available options are: join date (default, descending), member name, and expiry date (the member's current membership item's `end_date`, via `member_list_view`) — resolving the direction ambiguity screens.md left open.

**REQ-LIST-002**
- Given staff type into the search box, when the query matches a substring of a member's name, member number, or phone number (case-insensitive, phone ignoring spaces), then that member appears in results.
- Given the query matches none of those three fields for a member, then that member is excluded from the results.

**REQ-LIST-003**
- Given the "Active" pill is selected, when filtering, then only members whose current membership item has an `end_date` today or later with more than 7 days remaining, or an indefinite (NULL `end_date`) item, are shown.
- Given the "Expiring" pill is selected, when filtering, then only members whose current membership item's `end_date` is within 7 days (inclusive) of today are shown.
- Given the "Expired" pill is selected, when filtering, then only members whose current membership item's `end_date` has passed, or who have no current membership item at all, are shown.
- Given "All" is selected (or no pill selected), then no status filtering is applied.

**REQ-LIST-004**
- Given staff select one or more genders in the filter panel, when applied, then only members matching one of the selected genders are shown.
- Given staff select one or more add-ons in the filter panel, when applied, then only members with at least one of the selected add-on plans among their **current** add-on items (`member_current_items`, `category = 'addon'`) are shown — "current" means not soft-deleted and (indefinite or `end_date >= today`), same definition `member_current_items` already uses; there is no cancellation concept to also check (deferred, see REQ-SUB-011).
- Given staff select one or more plans in the filter panel, when applied, then only members whose **current membership item** (the `category = 'membership'` item with the latest `end_date`, per `member_list_view`) uses one of the selected plans are shown.
- All filter-panel selections combine with each other (AND), and are additive with the pill filter and search box, consistent with the existing filter-panel behavior in screens.md.

### 3.3 Data touched

- No new Member fields — reuses `Member.date_of_joining` (already required, see Member Management).
- List/search/filter/sort all read from `member_list_view` (see [backend/member-management.md §5](./backend/member-management.md#5-member_list_view--resolving-the-member-status-open-question)), which joins `Member` against `member_current_items` for the current membership item and the set of current add-on plan ids — **resolved**, superseding the old "member + latest subscription" join note.
- Search additionally reuses `Member.name`, `Member.phone`, and `Member.member_number` (REQ-MEM-005) — no new fields.
- Add-on filter reads `member_list_view.current_addon_plan_ids` (an array, since a member can have multiple current add-ons across independent checkouts) — not a single Member field.
- Plan filter reads `member_list_view.current_membership_plan_id`.
- **API implication**: none beyond querying `member_list_view` directly — at this app's scale, the full view result set is fetched once per route entry and search/filter/sort happen client-side (no server-side filter parameters needed); see [backend/member-management.md §5.4](./backend/member-management.md#54-usage).

### 3.4 Business rules specific to this area

- Default list sort is `date_of_joining DESC`. This is a pure read/display rule, like Member Status derivation in business-logic.md — no security implications, so client-side sorting of already-fetched data is sufficient; it doesn't need server-side enforcement beyond the query itself defaulting to this order.
- Search matches name/member_number/phone by substring, case-insensitive; phone ignores spaces — consistent with the existing name/phone search rule in screens.md, now extended to member_number.
- The pill filter reuses the exact Active/Expiring Soon/Expired definitions and 7-day threshold already defined in business-logic.md's Member Status section — not a new rule, just exposed as a quick filter.
- **Resolved** (was an open question — see [backend/member-management.md §5](./backend/member-management.md#5-member_list_view--resolving-the-member-status-open-question)): the plan filter and status pills evaluate against the member's **current membership item** — the `category = 'membership'` item in `member_current_items` with the latest `end_date` (an indefinite item outranks any dated one) — not a single "latest subscription" row, which no longer exists under the header/line-item model. The add-on filter is evaluated against **all** of the member's current add-on items, not just one, since a member can hold several independently.

## 4. Feature Area: Subscription Management

### 4.1 Requirements

> **Cancellation and refunds are deferred** in this revision — see [domain-model.md §Open items](./backend/domain-model.md#open-items-not-blocking-but-worth-resolving-before-implementation-begins). The REQ IDs below that covered that ground are kept (marked *Deferred*) for traceability, not deleted, so this work can be picked back up without losing the original acceptance criteria.
>
> **Overlap-warning checks (REQ-SUB-005/008) are resolved**, but with a deliberately lighter design than the original: a **client-side-only** warn-then-allow check, run just before `create-subscription` is called — no `overlap_override`/`overlap_conflict_subscription_id` columns, no server-side enforcement, and no persisted record of which checkouts triggered or dismissed the warning. It's a UX safety net against accidental double-booking, not a security control; a forged direct call to `create-subscription` bypasses it entirely, same as any other client-side-only check in this app.

| ID | Requirement | Who can do it | Priority (Must/Should/Could) |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-SUB-001 | Once a member exists, staff/admin can create a subscription (one checkout) for that member: add one or more catalog items — exactly one must be a `category = 'membership'` plan — each with its own start date (defaults to today, editable) and amount paid (defaults to that item's plan price × quantity, editable), plus one payment mode covering the whole checkout. A subscription's items are fixed once created; adding something new later (e.g. a class the following month) always creates a **new** subscription, never adds to an existing one. | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-SUB-002 | Subscription payment mode supports Cash, UPI, or Card — one value per checkout, covering every item created in it. | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-SUB-003 | Staff/admin can add one or more add-on-category items to the same checkout as the membership item, chosen from the unified catalog (REQ-ADMIN-002). Each item's cost is shown clearly in the UI, itemized separately. | staff, admin | Should |
| REQ-SUB-004 | Plans carry a `max_members` value (default 1). For a membership-category plan with `max_members = 2` (e.g. a "Couple" plan), staff can optionally set a second, **shared** member on that item **at creation time only**. There is currently no path to add, change, or clear the shared member after the subscription is created — a narrower capability than the previous design (which allowed editing the secondary member later); see §13 Open Questions. | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-SUB-005 | *(Resolved — client-side only)* Before saving a checkout, the client warns (does not block) when a new `category = 'membership'` item's date range overlaps **any** existing non-deleted membership item for that member (as primary `member_id` or `shared_member_id`) — regardless of `plan_id`, since a member logically has one membership at a time. Staff can dismiss the warning and save anyway. | staff, admin | Should |
| REQ-SUB-006 | A catalog item's duration is expressed by `Plan.duration_days`: NULL means indefinite (charged once, never expires, cannot be attached again to a member who already has it — REQ-SUB-007); a positive number of days means it's time-boxed and can be attached again later (e.g. a new term). This single column replaces the old separate `behavior_type` field. | admin (catalog, REQ-ADMIN-002), staff (attaching) | Must |
| REQ-SUB-007 | An indefinite item (`Plan.duration_days IS NULL`) cannot be attached to a member who already has a non-deleted `SubscriptionItem` referencing it — a hard block, not a warning. This check only needs to look for an existing row, not a status, so it stands independently of the deferred cancellation logic (REQ-SUB-011). | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-SUB-008 | *(Resolved — client-side only)* Same warn-then-allow mechanism as REQ-SUB-005, but scoped to `category = 'addon'` items: the check only compares against existing non-deleted items referencing the **same** `plan_id` for that member — a member can hold several different add-ons concurrently (REQ-SUB-003) without triggering this, but two overlapping instances of the *same* add-on (e.g. two overlapping "Zumba Class" items) do. | staff, admin | Should |
| REQ-SUB-009 | When adding any catalog item (membership or add-on) with a duration to a checkout, staff can select a quantity/multiplier for its standard period (preset chips ×1/×2/×3/×6/×12, plus a custom number field), extending that item's duration and price by that multiple — e.g. a Monthly plan × 2 = 60 days at 2× the price. Not shown for indefinite items, which have no duration to multiply. Applies uniformly to membership and add-on items — no longer a separate control per type. | staff, admin | Should |
| REQ-SUB-010 | *(Deferred)* Reducing a `SubscriptionItem`'s quantity after creation ("partial cancellation") — no edit path exists for quantity at all after creation in this revision. | — | Deferred |
| REQ-SUB-011 | *(Deferred)* Cancel & Refund flow (status, refund amount, cancelled-by/at) for a subscription item. | — | Deferred |
| REQ-SUB-012 | *(Resolved — no longer deferred)* "Member's current status" no longer maps to a single "latest subscription" — a member's current items can now come from multiple, independent checkouts (`Subscription` rows) at once, unioned via `member_current_items` (domain-model.md §Views). REQ-LIST-001/003/004 are re-implemented against `member_list_view`, which derives status from the `category = 'membership'` item with the latest `end_date` — see [backend/member-management.md §5](./backend/member-management.md#5-member_list_view--resolving-the-member-status-open-question). | — | Resolved |

### 4.2 Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-SUB-001**
- Given staff open "add subscription", when the form loads, then they can add one or more catalog items to the checkout; submission is blocked unless exactly one added item is a `category = 'membership'` plan.
- Given each added item, when the form loads it, then `start_date` is pre-filled with today's date and `amount_paid` is pre-filled with that item's plan price × the selected quantity (REQ-SUB-009; quantity defaults to ×1) — both editable.
- Given all required items are filled in and a payment mode is chosen, when staff submit, then one `subscriptions` row and one `subscription_items` row per added item are created together, in a single transaction.
- Given a subscription already exists, when staff want to add something new for that member later, then they start a new "add subscription" checkout rather than editing the existing one.

**REQ-SUB-003**
- Given one or more add-on-category items are added to a checkout alongside the membership item, when it is saved, then each item's cost is itemized separately, both in the UI and in what's stored (one `subscription_items` row per item).

**REQ-SUB-004**
- Given a membership-category plan with `max_members = 2` is selected for an item during subscription creation, when the form is shown, then staff can optionally set a shared member for that item, in addition to its primary `member_id`, before saving.
- Given such a subscription is saved without a shared member, when staff later view it, then there is currently no UI action to add one there — flagged as a gap versus the previous design in §13 Open Questions.

**REQ-SUB-005**
- Given a new `category = 'membership'` item's `[start_date, end_date]` range overlaps an existing non-deleted membership item (any `plan_id`) for the same member (as `member_id` or `shared_member_id`), when staff attempt to save the checkout, then a warning is shown naming the conflicting plan and its dates, with the option to cancel (stay on the form) or proceed (save anyway).
- Given staff choose to proceed, when the checkout is saved, then it saves exactly as if no conflict had been detected — no flag, column, or audit-log entry records that an overlap warning was shown or dismissed.
- Given an existing conflicting item is indefinite (`end_date IS NULL`), then it is treated as open-ended (always overlapping) for this comparison — though in practice a new indefinite item can't reach this check at all, since REQ-SUB-007's hard block already prevents re-attaching an indefinite plan.
- Given this check runs entirely client-side, when a request bypasses the client and calls `create-subscription` directly, then the checkout saves with no warning and no rejection — this requirement has no server-side enforcement.

**REQ-SUB-006**
- Given admin creates a catalog item with no duration, when saved, then it's treated as indefinite — no `end_date` is ever computed for `SubscriptionItem` rows referencing it.
- Given admin creates a catalog item with a duration in days, when saved, then that item is time-boxed and its `SubscriptionItem` rows get a computed `end_date`.

**REQ-SUB-007**
- Given a member already has a non-deleted `SubscriptionItem` referencing an indefinite plan (from any past subscription), when staff try to add that same plan to a new checkout for that member, then it is not offered/selectable, or submission is blocked with a clear error — no warning-and-override path for this case.

**REQ-SUB-008**
- Given a new `category = 'addon'` item's `[start_date, end_date]` range overlaps an existing non-deleted item referencing the **same** `plan_id` for the same member, when staff attempt to save the checkout, then the same warn-then-allow flow as REQ-SUB-005 applies (naming the conflicting item and its dates, cancel-or-proceed).
- Given a new add-on item's date range overlaps an existing item of a **different** `plan_id` (e.g. Zumba Class overlapping Personal Training), then no warning is shown — different add-ons are expected to run concurrently.
- Given staff choose to proceed, then the same "no trace left behind" rule as REQ-SUB-005 applies — nothing is persisted about the warning having fired.

**REQ-SUB-009**
- Given staff add a catalog item with a duration to a checkout, when they reach its quantity control, then preset chips are shown (×1, ×2, ×3, ×6, ×12) plus a custom-number field, defaulting to ×1.
- Given staff select a quantity of N, when the form recalculates, then `end_date = start_date + (plan.duration_days × N) - 1` and `amount_paid` defaults to `plan.price × N` — straight multiplication, no bulk discount.
- Given quantity stays at the default ×1, then behavior is unchanged from a normal single-period item.

### 4.3 Data touched

- **Subscription** (header — see domain-model.md §5): `member_id`, `payment_mode` (Cash/UPI/Card, one per checkout), `notes`. No plan, dates, quantity, or amount live here.
- **SubscriptionItem** (one row per catalog item selected in a checkout — see domain-model.md §6): `subscription_id`, `plan_id`, `member_id`, `shared_member_id` (nullable, only for a `max_members = 2` membership item — REQ-SUB-004), `start_date`, `end_date` (computed, null for indefinite items), `quantity` (default 1 — REQ-SUB-009), `amount_paid`.
- **Plan** (unified catalog, replaces the old Plan + AddOn split — see domain-model.md §3 and REQ-ADMIN-002): `name`, `category` ('membership' | 'addon'), `duration_days` (nullable — replaces `behavior_type`), `price`, `max_members` (only meaningful for `category = 'membership'`).
- No `status`, `refund_amount`, `cancellation_reason`, `cancelled_by`/`cancelled_at`, `overlap_override`, or `overlap_conflict_*` field exists on either table in this revision.

### 4.4 Business rules specific to this area

- A subscription (checkout) always has exactly one membership-category item and zero or more add-on-category items, created together and never modified afterward (REQ-SUB-001).
- `end_date` computation includes `quantity`: `start_date + (plan.duration_days × quantity) - 1`, or NULL when `plan.duration_days IS NULL`. The plan-deletion guard from business-logic.md is unchanged in spirit, now checking `subscription_items.plan_id` instead of `subscriptions.plan_id`.
- Payment mode stays Cash / UPI / Card, but is now a single value per checkout, not per item — a behavior change from the previous design, where an add-on could record its own independent payment mode. Flagged in §13 if that capability turns out to be needed.
- The catalog (name, category, price, duration) is admin-configured (REQ-ADMIN-002); staff choose from it per checkout item, they don't type in ad-hoc fees.
- `quantity` is set at creation time (REQ-SUB-009), defaults to 1, and always multiplies duration and price linearly (no bulk discount logic), uniformly for membership and add-on items. There is currently no path to change it afterward at all.
- Indefinite items are hard-blocked from being attached twice to the same member (REQ-SUB-007) — independent of the deferred cancellation logic.
- Every `SubscriptionItem` belongs to exactly one primary `member_id`; a couple-plan's membership item additionally has an optional `shared_member_id`. An add-on item never sets `shared_member_id`, even on a couple's subscription.
- **Deferred, not implemented in this revision**: overlap warnings (REQ-SUB-005/008), quantity reduction (REQ-SUB-010), cancellation/refund (REQ-SUB-011), and "latest subscription" status derivation (REQ-SUB-012, redefined as an open question in §13).

## 5. Feature Area: Add-on Management

**Merged into Plan Management (REQ-ADMIN-002).** Add-ons are no longer a separate catalog entity — they're `Plan` rows with `category = 'addon'` (see domain-model.md §3). The old REQ-ADDON-001 (name/price/behavior-type/duration CRUD, `refundable` flag, deletion guard) is superseded: catalog CRUD for both categories now lives entirely under REQ-ADMIN-002, and the `refundable` flag is deferred along with the rest of the cancellation/refund design (domain-model.md §Open items).

---

## 6. Feature Area: Reporting

### 6.1 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Who can do it | Priority (Must/Should/Could) |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-REPORT-001 | A Reports page shows two bar charts — "New Subscriptions per Month" and "New Add-ons per Month" — for a selected date range. Defaults to the current calendar month; staff/admin can pick a custom start/end date, and both charts always bucket counts by calendar month regardless of range length. | staff, admin | Should |
| REQ-REPORT-002 | Below the charts, a data list shows one row per subscription or add-on transaction created within the selected date range: member name, member number, phone number, transaction type (Subscription/Add-on), plan or add-on name, transaction date, amount, and payment mode. | staff, admin | Should |

### 6.2 Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-REPORT-001**
- Given staff/admin opens the Reports page, when it loads with no custom range selected, then the default range is the 1st of the current calendar month through today.
- Given staff/admin selects a custom start/end date, when applied, then both charts and the data list recalculate for that exact range.
- Given the selected range spans multiple months, when the charts render, then each chart still shows one bar per calendar month within that range — never daily or weekly bars.
- Given a subscription or add-on's `start_date` falls within the selected range, when counting, then it's included in that month's bar — counted by `start_date` (membership period start), not `created_at` (record entry time).

**REQ-REPORT-002**
- Given the selected date range, when the data list loads, then it shows one row per `SubscriptionItem` whose `start_date` falls in that range, labeled with its transaction type (derived from `plan.category`: Subscription for `'membership'`, Add-on for `'addon'`).
- Given a member has multiple items in the selected range (e.g. a renewal plus two add-ons), then each item appears as its own separate row — no aggregation into a single member row.
- Given each row, when displayed, then it shows: member name, member number, phone number, transaction type, plan/add-on name, transaction date, amount, and payment mode — payment mode now comes from the item's **parent `Subscription`** (one value per checkout, shared by every row in that checkout), not from the item itself. This is narrower than the previous design, where an add-on could record its own independent payment mode within the same checkout — see §13 Open Questions.

### 6.3 Data touched

- Reads `SubscriptionItem` (start_date, plan_id, amount_paid, member_id, subscription_id) within the selected date range, joined to its parent `Subscription` (payment_mode), `Member` (name, member_number, phone), and `Plan` (name, category — used to label the row Subscription vs Add-on).
- No new Member fields. Both charts in REQ-REPORT-001 now read from the same `subscription_items` table, split by `plan.category`, instead of two separate tables.
- **API implication**: needs a reporting endpoint/query that accepts a date range and returns (a) monthly counts of new membership items, (b) monthly counts of new add-on items, and (c) the itemized transaction list for that same range.

### 6.4 Business rules specific to this area

- The Reports page is available to all signed-in users (staff and admin) — same access level as the Member List, not admin-restricted.
- Chart grouping is always by calendar month, regardless of the selected range's length — no adaptive daily/weekly granularity.
- The transaction list always reflects one row per item, never aggregated per member — consistent with REQ-REPORT-002.
- "New" is counted by `start_date` falling in the selected range, not `created_at`. Cancellation-aware reporting (marking a row as refunded once REQ-SUB-011 exists) is deferred along with the rest of the cancellation design — every row here is simply "created," with no cancelled/active distinction yet.

---

## 7. Feature Area: User Authentication

### 7.1 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Who can do it | Priority (Must/Should/Could) |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-AUTH-001 | Staff/admin can sign in with email + password via Supabase Auth. | staff, admin | Must |
| REQ-AUTH-002 | Staff/admin can alternatively sign in with Google (Supabase OAuth), using the same email as their invited account — no separate signup step; it auto-links to their existing account. | staff, admin | Should |
| REQ-AUTH-003 | Google sign-in is **invite-only**, same as the rest of the app: if the signed-in Google account's email has no matching `profiles` row, access is blocked with a clear "not invited" message — no `profiles` row is auto-created. | system (enforced, not user-facing config) | Must |
| REQ-AUTH-004 | A single account supports both sign-in methods at once — password and Google — interchangeably; both map to the same `auth.users` row and the same `profiles` row. | staff, admin | Should |
| REQ-AUTH-005 | A user with a password-based account can request a password reset via a "Forgot password" link, using Supabase Auth's built-in password-recovery email flow. | staff, admin | Must |

### 7.2 Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-AUTH-001**
- Given an invited user with a set password, when they enter their email + password on the login screen, then Supabase Auth verifies and signs them in.
- Given incorrect credentials, when submitted, then a generic error is shown that doesn't confirm whether the email is registered, consistent with REQ-AUTH-003's "don't leak invited emails" pattern.

**REQ-AUTH-002**
- Given an invited user, when they click "Sign in with Google" and complete Google's OAuth flow using their invited email, then they are signed in without any separate password-setup step.
- Given a user who previously only had a password, when they complete Google OAuth with the matching email for the first time, then Supabase links the Google identity to their existing `auth.users` record rather than creating a second account.

**REQ-AUTH-003**
- Given a Google account whose email has no matching `profiles` row, when they complete Google's OAuth flow, then the underlying Supabase Auth step may succeed, but the app checks for a `profiles` row immediately after and blocks entry with a message such as "This email hasn't been invited — contact your admin."
- Given this blocked state, when it's detected, then the app signs the session back out — a successful Google OAuth handshake alone never grants access to any app data.

**REQ-AUTH-004**
- Given a user with both a password and a linked Google identity, when they sign in with either method, then they land in the same session, same `profiles` row, same role and permissions.

**REQ-AUTH-005**
- Given a user clicks "Forgot password" and enters their email, when submitted, then Supabase Auth sends a password-reset email if that email has a matching account — the response message is generic either way (doesn't confirm whether the email exists), consistent with REQ-AUTH-003's non-leaking pattern.
- Given the user follows the reset link and sets a new password, when submitted, then their password is updated and they can sign in with the new password immediately.
- Given a user who has only ever signed in via Google (no password set), when they use "Forgot password" with their invited email, then the same flow lets them set a password for the first time — Supabase treats this as adding a sign-in method to their existing account, not creating a new one.

### 7.3 Data touched

- No new fields — reuses `auth.users` and `profiles` exactly as already defined in [database.md](./backend/database.md) and [domain-model.md](./backend/domain-model.md). Google sign-in is a Supabase Auth identity-linking feature (multiple providers per `auth.users` row), not a schema change. Password reset likewise uses Supabase Auth's built-in recovery-email flow — no custom token/email infrastructure needed.
- **Config, not data**: the Google OAuth provider must be enabled in the Supabase Auth dashboard/CLI config — an infrastructure/setup step, not a migration.

### 7.4 Business rules specific to this area

- Invite-only account creation applies uniformly regardless of sign-in method — this closes a gap the existing [architecture.md](./architecture.md) left open when it listed Google OAuth as "optional later" without saying how it interacts with the invite-only model. There is still no client-side path to create a `profiles` row other than the `invite-user` Edge Function (admin-only) — Google sign-in never creates one.
- Sign-in method (password vs Google) has no bearing on authorization — the existing deactivation rule (`is_active = false` blocks access immediately via RLS, see database.md), role model (admin/staff), and audit rules all apply identically regardless of how the user authenticated.
- Errors deliberately avoid confirming whether a given email is invited/registered, for both password and Google sign-in failures — consistent, non-leaking error messaging across both methods, and this extends to REQ-AUTH-005's password-reset request too.

---

## 8. Feature Area: Audit Trail / Change History

### 8.1 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Who can do it | Priority (Must/Should/Could) |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-AUDIT-001 | Every table in the system (Member, Subscription, SubscriptionItem, Plan, Branch, Profile — no exceptions) records a field-level entry in a shared audit log whenever a field is inserted, updated, or deleted, capturing the old value and the new value. | system (backend-enforced, not user-facing) | Should |

### 8.2 Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-AUDIT-001**
- Given any field on any table's row changes value during an update, when the save completes, then a new audit-log row is written with the table name, record id, field name, old value, new value, operation `update`, who changed it, and when.
- Given a new row is inserted into any table, when the save completes, then one audit-log row is written per field the row was created with — `old_value = null`, `new_value` = that field's initial value, operation `insert`.
- Given a row is deleted from any table, when the delete completes, then one audit-log row is written per field the deleted row had — `old_value` = its last value, `new_value = null`, operation `delete`.
- Given a single save changes several fields at once (e.g. editing a member's phone and email together), when it completes, then that many separate audit-log rows are written, sharing the same record id/changed-by/changed-at but each with its own field name and old/new value.
- Given the audit-metadata columns themselves (`created_at`, `created_by`, `changed_at`, `changed_by`), then they are **not** separately logged — they are the metadata, not business data, so auditing them would just duplicate what the audit-log entry itself already records.

### 8.3 Data touched

- **AuditLog** (new entity, separate from every other table): id, `table_name` (text), `record_id` (text — stored as text so it can hold both the `bigint` PKs most tables use and the `uuid` PK `Profile` uses, in one shared column), `field_name` (text), `old_value` (text, nullable), `new_value` (text, nullable), `operation` ('insert' | 'update' | 'delete'), `changed_by` (FK → profiles), `changed_at` (timestamptz).
- No new fields on any existing table — this is purely an additional table fed by triggers on every other table.

### 8.4 Business rules specific to this area

- Implemented as a generic trigger (AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) attached to every table, comparing OLD vs NEW row-by-row and field-by-field — a separate, additional mechanism from the existing lightweight `set_audit_fields()` trigger in [database.md](./backend/database.md) (which only tracks who/when on the row itself, not per-field history). Both continue to exist; this doesn't replace that.
- `old_value`/`new_value` are stored as text regardless of the source column's real type (numeric, boolean, date, etc.), since one shared audit table must accommodate every column type across every table.
- No dedicated per-record "History" view exists yet (e.g. on a member or subscription's detail page) — the only screen that reads this table is the admin-only, view-only overview added in REQ-ADMIN-005 below.
- Because this runs as a database trigger, it captures changes made through any path uniformly — RLS-guarded direct client writes and service-role Edge Function writes alike — consistent with the server-side-authority principle already established in [architecture.md](./architecture.md); it cannot be bypassed by writing through a different layer.

---

## 9. Feature Area: Admin Data Management

### 9.1 Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Who can do it | Priority (Must/Should/Could) |
|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-ADMIN-001 | Admin has a dedicated overview (list) and edit screen for **every** entity in the domain model: Member, Subscription, SubscriptionItem, Plan, Branch, Profile (Users), and AuditLog. Entities that already have a purpose-built flow elsewhere in this spec (Member, Subscription, SubscriptionItem) satisfy this requirement via that existing flow — no duplicate screen is built for them. Entities without one yet get a new dedicated screen: REQ-ADMIN-002 through 006 below. | admin | Should |
| REQ-ADMIN-002 | **Plan Management**: admin can view a list of all catalog items (both `category = 'membership'` and `category = 'addon'` rows, one unified list) and create/edit them (name, category, duration_days — required for membership, optional for add-on, price, max_members — membership only). Supersedes the old separate Add-on Management area (§5). | admin | Should |
| REQ-ADMIN-003 | **Branch Management**: admin can view a list of all branches and create/edit them (name, code). | admin | Should |
| REQ-ADMIN-004 | **User Management**: admin can view a list of all staff/admin accounts (name, email, role, active status) and edit role/active-status/full name, and invite new users. | admin | Should |
| REQ-ADMIN-005 | **Audit Log overview**: admin can view a filterable/searchable list of AuditLog entries (by table, record, date range, changed-by) — view-only, no edit or delete capability. | admin | Could |
| REQ-MEM-008 | A **system admin** can permanently delete a member — the one hard delete in the app. The member, their subscriptions, line items, change history and photo files are erased for good; staff and ordinary admins keep only the soft delete of REQ-MEM-007. |
| REQ-ADMIN-010 | The reserved **`system_admin`** role: an admin who can also permanently delete a member and grant or remove this role. Seeded, never editable, renamed or deletable, and only ever held together with `admin`. |
| REQ-ADMIN-006 | Admin can delete a user account — a separate, more severe action than the existing active/inactive toggle (REQ-ADMIN-004). A deleted user is fully hidden from User Management's list, same soft-delete convention as every other entity (Section 11). An admin can never delete their own account. | admin | Should |

### 9.2 Acceptance Criteria

**REQ-ADMIN-001**
- Given admin navigates the app, when looking for any entity's data, then there is always a screen where they can see a list of all records of that type and edit one — no entity is a dead end reachable only via direct database access.
- Given staff (not admin), when they try to reach any of REQ-ADMIN-002 through 006, then access is denied — these screens are admin-only, consistent with the existing role model (see Section 1).

**REQ-ADMIN-002**
- Given admin opens Plan Management, when the list loads, then it shows every catalog item (name, category, duration_days, price, max_members), both membership plans and add-ons together, filterable by category.
- Given admin creates or edits an item with `category = 'membership'` and leaves `duration_days` blank, then submission is blocked with a validation error — duration is required for membership items, optional (indefinite) for add-on items.
- Given admin edits an item, when saved, then the change applies immediately (existing items/subscriptions are unaffected — editing a catalog item does not recalculate past `SubscriptionItem` rows, per the existing business-logic.md rule).
- Given admin tries to delete an item that's referenced by any `SubscriptionItem`, then deletion is blocked with the existing "used by X subscription(s)" error (unchanged from business-logic.md's Plan Deletion Guard).

**REQ-ADMIN-003**
- Given admin opens Branch Management, when the list loads, then it shows every branch (name, code).
- Given admin creates or edits a branch, when they submit a code already used by another (non-deleted) branch, then it's blocked with a validation error (unchanged from the existing branch `code` uniqueness rule).
- Given admin creates or edits a branch, when `name` or `code` is left blank, then submission is blocked with a validation error — both fields are mandatory.
- Given admin tries to delete a branch that has any member registered against it (`Member.branch_id`), then deletion is blocked with a "used by X member(s)" style error — same guard pattern as Plan (REQ-ADMIN-002).

**REQ-ADMIN-004**
- Given admin opens User Management, when the list loads, then it shows every profile (name, email — read from the authenticated session/`auth.users`, role, active status).
- Given admin invites a new user, when submitted, then it goes through the existing `invite-user` Edge Function flow (unchanged) — this screen is the UI entry point for that already-specified flow, not a new invite mechanism.
- Given admin tries to deactivate their own account from this screen, then it's blocked — matches the existing "an admin cannot deactivate their own account" rule.

**REQ-ADMIN-005**
- Given admin opens the Audit Log overview, when it loads, then entries can be filtered by table name, record id, date range, and who made the change.
- Given any AuditLog entry, when viewed, then there is no edit or delete action available anywhere in the UI for it — the log is strictly append-only and read-only from every screen.

**REQ-MEM-008**
- Given a system admin on a member's detail screen, when they choose "Delete permanently", then a dialog names the member, warns it cannot be undone, and enables the button only once `DELETE` is typed exactly.
- Given the purge succeeds, then the member, all their subscriptions and items, their audit history and their photo files are gone; nothing is written to the audit log for the purge itself.
- Given staff, an ordinary admin, or a user who holds `system_admin` without `admin`, then the button is not shown and both `purge-member` and `purge_member()` refuse the call.
- Given the member is the shared (couple) member on another member's subscription item, then the purge is refused with a message and nothing is changed — items are immutable.
- Given the purge fails at any point in the database, then nothing is deleted. If only the photo files fail to delete, the rows stay erased and the failure is logged.

**REQ-ADMIN-010**
- Given an ordinary admin, when they try to grant or remove `system_admin` (Manage Users, Invite User or the API), then it is refused; editing a system admin's other roles is allowed while `system_admin` stays in the list.
- Given `system_admin` is requested without `admin`, then it is refused.
- Given the `system_admin` role, then it cannot be edited, renamed or deleted, and Manage Roles shows "Reserved" instead of Edit/Delete.
- Given a system admin is deactivated or loses `admin`, then they lose the purge power at once.

**REQ-ADMIN-006**
- Given admin deletes a user account, when confirmed, then that profile's `deleted_at`/`deleted_by` are set — the row is never physically removed, and the user immediately loses all access (same enforcement as the existing `is_active = false` rule, extended to also cover `deleted_at`).
- Given admin tries to delete their own account, then it's blocked — same self-protection pattern as the existing "cannot deactivate/demote own account" rule.
- Given a deleted user, when User Management's list loads, then that user is excluded by default, same as any other soft-deleted entity (Section 11).
- Deleting a user is distinct from deactivating one (`is_active = false`): deactivation is a reversible toggle still visible in the list; deletion hides the account entirely.


### 9.3 Data touched

- No new fields on any entity. Reads: `Plan`, `Branch`, `Profile`/`auth.users`, and `AuditLog` — all already defined by earlier requirements/existing spec files. REQ-ADMIN-006 reuses `Profile`'s standard `deleted_at`/`deleted_by` soft-delete columns (Section 11) — no new field.
- **API implication**: needs list + create/update queries for Plan and Branch (straightforward CRUD, RLS-guarded, admin-only), a list/invite/update/delete flow for Profile (reusing the existing `invite-user` Edge Function, plus a delete action for REQ-ADMIN-006), and a read-only filtered query for AuditLog.

### 9.4 Business rules specific to this area

- Every screen in this area (REQ-ADMIN-002 through 006) is admin-only — staff get no access, not even read-only, consistent with your explicit "admin can get..." framing (unlike Plans' existing RLS, which already grants staff *read* access at the data layer; the UI screen itself is still admin-gated here).
- REQ-ADMIN-001 doesn't introduce new business rules of its own for Member/Subscription/SubscriptionItem — it just confirms their existing screens (Member Management, Member List/Home Page, Subscription Management) are sufficient and no redundant admin-only duplicate is built for them; catalog management (Plan + the old Add-on Management) is covered by REQ-ADMIN-002 alone.
- The Audit Log is never editable or deletable from any UI, by any role — this is absolute, since an editable audit trail defeats its own purpose.
- User deletion (REQ-ADMIN-006) and user deactivation (`is_active`, REQ-ADMIN-004) are two distinct, independent actions — deleting a user does not require deactivating them first, and an inactive user can still be deleted. Both share the same self-protection rule: an admin can never apply either action to their own account.

...

## 10. Non-Functional Requirements

| Category | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Performance | Member list must load in < 1s for up to ~2,000 members. |
| Security | Only authenticated, invited users (i.e. a matching `profiles` row, see REQ-AUTH-003) may access any data; every write is authorized by role (admin/staff, Section 1) and enforced server-side via RLS/Edge Functions, not just hidden in the UI. |
| Availability | Best-effort, no formal SLA — single deployment, occasional downtime for deploys/maintenance is acceptable. |
| Scale | Single gym business (with multiple branches, see Section 11), a few hundred to low-thousands of members, under 20 concurrent staff/admin users. |
| Auditability | Every table has `created_at`, `created_by`, `changed_at`, `changed_by`; every insert/update/delete additionally produces field-level entries in the shared `AuditLog` (REQ-AUDIT-001) — no write path bypasses this. |
| Data retention / deletion | All entities support **soft delete only** — a `deleted_at` (timestamptz, nullable) and `deleted_by` (uuid, nullable) column pair, mirroring the existing `created_at`/`created_by` and `changed_at`/`changed_by` audit columns. A row is considered deleted when `deleted_at is not null`; there is no separate boolean flag. The app never performs a hard/physical delete. Soft-deleted rows are excluded from all API responses and UI reads by default. A soft delete is itself just an update, so it passes through the same audit logging as any other field change (REQ-AUDIT-001). Subscription/member history is otherwise kept indefinitely. |

---

## 11. Constraints & Assumptions

- Single-tenant: one gym business only, no multi-tenant requirement. Multiple **branches** (physical locations) are supported, but only as a simple data field on Member — used at registration and for member-number generation (REQ-MEM-005). Branches do **not** drive access control, filtering, or reporting scope today: every staff/admin account can see and manage members across all branches. Branch-scoped permissions/reporting are explicitly out of scope for now (Section 12).
- No payment gateway integration — payments (Cash/UPI/Card) are recorded manually as a label, never processed by the app.
- Every entity uses soft delete (`deleted_at`/`deleted_by`), never a hard delete — see Section 10's Data retention row. Any "delete" acceptance criteria elsewhere in this spec (Plan, Branch, Profile) means setting `deleted_at`/`deleted_by`, guarded where noted.
- Every entity carries the standard audit columns (`created_at`, `created_by`, `changed_at`, `changed_by`) plus field-level history in `AuditLog` (REQ-AUDIT-001) — this is a blanket convention, not repeated field-by-field in every feature area's Data Touched section.
- Spec-driven development: this requirements doc (and the domain-model/business-logic/API-contract docs it feeds) must be updated *before* any corresponding functional code change ships — the spec is the source of truth, not the implementation.
- Platform: web only (Section 0), built on Supabase (Auth + Postgres + RLS + Edge Functions, per [architecture.md](./architecture.md)) — new requirements should reuse that stack's existing patterns (RLS for authorization, Edge Functions for privileged operations like invites) rather than introducing new ones ad hoc.
- Members do not have their own login or account — the app is staff/admin-only (Section 1); a `Member` row is just a record staff manage, never an authenticated identity. There is no member-facing role, auth flow, or self-service portal in scope.

---

## 12. Out of Scope

Explicitly list what this round of requirements does **not** cover, so it isn't accidentally designed for. Move items here to a Feature Area section later if they become real requirements.

- Automated expiry email/SMS notifications.
- Branch-based access control — e.g. restricting a staff member to only see/manage members at their own branch (see Section 11).
- Branch-specific reporting or member-list filtering (no "filter by branch" control exists in Reports or the Member List).
- True multi-tenant support (multiple independent gym businesses sharing one deployment/database).
- Age-range member filtering — considered for REQ-LIST-004, explicitly removed from scope for now.

---

## 13. Open Questions

Anything you're unsure about — don't guess, resolve before moving to the domain model.

- There's currently no standalone "all subscriptions" overview screen — Subscriptions are only reachable via a member's detail page, or the period-scoped list in Reporting (REQ-REPORT-002). Is that sufficient, or does REQ-ADMIN-001 also need a dedicated global Subscriptions list? (REQ-ADMIN-001)
- `Plan.max_members` only supports up to 2 members in the subscription UI (REQ-SUB-004). As a **stopgap**, the backend already enforces this at the database level with a hard `CHECK (max_members between 1 and 2)` constraint (database.md), tied to `SubscriptionItem.shared_member_id`'s single-column (not join-table) data model — not a confirmed permanent product decision. Deliberately not generalized to a real multi-member join table preemptively; revisit only if/when a 3+-member plan is actually requested.
- **New, from the header/line-item redesign**: cancellation, refunds, and overlap-warning checks (the old REQ-SUB-005/008/010/011) are entirely deferred — there is no way to cancel a `SubscriptionItem`, issue a refund, or warn about overlapping dates in this revision. Needs a follow-up design pass; see [domain-model.md §Open items](./backend/domain-model.md#open-items-not-blocking-but-worth-resolving-before-implementation-begins).
- **New**: `SubscriptionItem.shared_member_id` can only be set at creation time (REQ-SUB-004) — the previous design's "add/change/clear the secondary member later" edit path has no equivalent yet. Is that an acceptable gap for now, or does it need its own edit function before this ships?
- **New**: payment mode moved from per-item (old `SubscriptionAddOn.payment_mode`, independent of the parent subscription) to per-checkout (`Subscription.payment_mode`, one value shared by every item in it — REQ-SUB-002/004.4). This is a real capability regression: a member paying for their membership by card and an add-on by cash *in the same checkout* can no longer be recorded that way — they'd need two separate checkouts. Confirm this tradeoff is acceptable.
- ~~**New**: "member's current status"...~~ **Resolved.** Status derives from the member's `category = 'membership'` item(s) via `member_current_items`, using whichever has the latest `end_date` (an indefinite/NULL-`end_date` item outranks any dated one, and is treated as always-Active) — implemented as `member_list_view`. See [backend/member-management.md §5](./backend/member-management.md#5-member_list_view--resolving-the-member-status-open-question) for the view definition and [§6](./backend/member-management.md#6-status-derivation-client-side-unchanged-authority--see-business-logicmd) for the derivation logic. REQ-LIST-001/003/004 and their acceptance criteria have been updated to match.

---

## How this feeds the next stages

1. **Each Feature Area's `.3 Data touched` subsection** (Sections 2–9) → merged into the **domain model** (entities, fields, relationships), plus the blanket audit/soft-delete conventions in Section 11.
2. **Each Feature Area's `.1 Requirements` + `.4 Business rules` subsections** (Sections 2–9) → become the **business-logic.md** rules and drive which operations need an **API contract**.
3. **Section 1 (Actors & Roles)** → becomes the **RLS policy / auth** design.
4. **Section 10 (Non-functional)** → informs indexing, caching, and infra decisions.

Do not start the domain model or API spec until every `<...>` placeholder above is either filled in or deliberately moved to Section 12 (Out of Scope) or Section 13 (Open Questions).
